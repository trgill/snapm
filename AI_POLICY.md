# Policy on the use of generative AI tools

The project welcomes contributions made with the assistance of AI coding
assistants and agents as long as they meet all the normal criteria for
correctness, clarity, formatting and so on. If you do use AI assistants to write
meaningful volumes of code, we prefer that you make this clear by including text
like the following in your commit message:

  Assisted-by: Some AI Tool <https://someai.example.com>

Replacing ‘Some AI Tool’ and the address with the name and URL of whatever tool
you used. The Assisted-by tag should immediately precede your DCO on a separate
line. This helps the maintainers to understand where the changes came from and
to track them over time. Inspect the current git logs for many prior examples of
this convention.
